## Development

### CTF organization commands
I have developed a few commands to help me with orginization of my folders for CTFs. Some of the commands include:
- ctf_init
- list_challenges
- create_challenge
- finish_challenge
- and more.

### bashrc and starship.toml
Included in the same Git as the organization commands is my bashrc and starship.toml files that I use for my terminal. There is some extra stuff in there that you will probably want to remove as I just copy and pasted the files for the most part.
